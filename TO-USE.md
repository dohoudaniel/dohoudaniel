# Hi — I'm Daniel 👋

**Software Engineer · Backend-focused · Product Builder**

I build production-grade backends, reliable developer tools, and user-focused Web3/AI features. I care deeply about maintainability, security-first design, and turning product problems into working software you can run and measure.

---

## 🚀 What I build right now

* **Smart ATS** — an AI-assisted applicant tracking system that surfaces *evidence* from CVs, repos and demos (live: [https://smart-ats.algorithmia-se.com](https://smart-ats.algorithmia-se.com)).
* **KoGidi** — Django-based educational platform with role-separated apps (students, teachers, parents) and secure cookie-based JWT auth.
* **JechSpace** — workspace booking & analytics platform (built with my hackathon team *Jechies*).
* **Learnopolia** — a growing library of curated educational materials and learning tools.

---

## 📌 Snapshot (TL;DR)

* Backend-first: Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery.
* Product-minded: I design APIs, ship features, and create clear case studies that show impact.
* Infra & ops: Docker, Nginx, GitHub Actions, Vercel/AWS.
* AI: Practical use of LLMs/APIs for feature automation and candidate evaluation (Smart ATS).

## 📂 Selected projects (short case studies)

### Smart ATS — Evidence-first hiring

**Problem:** Keyword-driven screening misses real candidate competence.
**Approach:** Ingest CVs + artifacts, extract evidence (commits, deployments, PRs), surface explainable ranking and interview prompts.
**Outcome:** Shortlists backed by artifacts and tailored prompts for faster, fairer interviewing.

### JechSpace — Workspace management

**Problem:** Small teams need bookings, check-ins, and analytics without bloated systems.
**Approach:** API-first design with auth, calendar integrations, and admin reporting.
**Outcome:** Lightweight deployment-ready workspace product with clear role separation.

### KoGidi — Education access & auth

**Problem:** Secure role-based access for students, teachers, and parents.
**Approach:** Three Django apps, cookie-based JWT auth, middleware for refresh/verification, and security-first defaults.
**Outcome:** A clear, maintainable backend architecture ready for scaling and offline-friendly features.

## 🔍 How to evaluate my work

1. **Run live demos** — start with Smart ATS (link above).
2. **Open each project README** — I include architecture, setup, and design decisions.
3. **Check commit history & CI** — look for meaningful commits, PRs, and tests.
4. **Run locally** — most repos include a `docker-compose` dev setup in the README.
